<h3>Surviving a blaze</h3>
<ul>
<li>Don't try to outrun the blaze. Instead, look for a body of water such as a pond or river to crouch in.</li>
<li>If there is no water nearby, find a depressed, cleared area with little vegetation, lie low to the ground, and cover your body with wet clothing, a blanket, or soil. Stay low and covered until the fire passes.</li>
<li>Protect your lungs by breathing air closest to the ground, through a mask or moist cloth, if possible, to reduce smoke inhalation.</li>
</ul>
