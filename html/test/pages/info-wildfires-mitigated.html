<h3>Wildfires, mitigated</h3>
<p>Firefighters often mitigate wildfires by water dousing and spraying fire retardants to extinguish existing fires. They also work in teams, often called hotshots, to clear vegetation to contain and eventually starve the fire of its fuel. The results are called firebreaks. Lastly, controlled burning, or creating backfires, is another process firefighters may employ to stop a wildfire. Literally, this method involves fighting fire with fire. These prescribed—and controlled—fires remove undergrowth, brush, and litter from a forest, depriving an otherwise raging wildfire of fuel.</p>
