<h3>Wildfires, explained</h3>
<p>Destruction caused by wildfires in the United States has significantly increased in the last two decades. An average of 72,400 wildfires cleared an average of 7 million acres of U.S. land each year since 2000, double the number of acres scorched by wildfires in the 1990s. In 2015, the largest wildfire season recorded in U.S. history, wildfires burned more than 10 million acres of land.</p>
<p>80% of all wildfires are caused by negligent human actions, such as leaving fires unattended, disposing of cigarette butts, and arson. The remaining 20% of wildfires spark to life during dry weather and droughts. Wildfires require three elements to initiate and grow. Fuel is any flammable material surrounding a fire, including trees, grasses, brush, even homes. The greater an area's fuel load, the more intense the fire is likely to be. Air supplies the oxygen a fire needs to burn. California wildfires are often made worse by the hot, dry Santa Ana winds, which can carry a spark for miles. Lastly, heat sources help spark the wildfire and bring fuel to temperatures hot enough to ignite. Lightning, burning campfires or cigarettes, and even the sun can all provide sufficient heat to spark a wildfire.</p>
